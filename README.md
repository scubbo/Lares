# Lares

A stateful AI agent with persistent memory - your household guardian.

Inspired by [Strix](https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/12/15/strix), Lares is an ambient AI assistant that maintains memory across conversations, learns about you over time, and can act proactively.

## Features

- **Dual Memory Modes**:
  - **Letta Mode**: Uses [Letta](https://letta.com) for managed memory and conversation
  - **Direct LLM Mode**: SQLite-based memory with direct Claude API integration
- **Persistent Memory**: Long-term memory that survives restarts with automatic compaction
- **Discord Interface**: Chat with Lares through Discord
- **Memory Blocks**: Organized memory for identity, human preferences, state, and ideas
- **Autonomous Operation**: "Perch time" ticks every hour for self-reflection and proactive actions
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Set reminders and recurring jobs with flexible scheduling
- **Self-Management**: Can restart itself for updates and maintenance
- **Tool System**: File operations, shell commands, RSS feeds, BlueSky integration, and more
- **Skills System**: Procedural memory through markdown files - teaches Lares how to perform tasks
- **MCP Server**: Portable tool layer via Model Context Protocol - connect any MCP-compatible system
- **Extensible**: Designed for adding new interfaces (Telegram, web) and capabilities

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- An LLM provider API key (Anthropic, OpenAI) or local Ollama installation
- A Discord bot token
- (Optional) A [Letta Cloud](https://app.letta.com) account for Letta mode

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://git.v37.io/daniele/lares.git
cd lares

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# (Optional) Enable self-restart capability
# This allows Lares to restart itself for updates and maintenance
sudo bash scripts/setup-sudoers.sh
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Copy example config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials:
# - DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: From Discord Developer Portal
# - DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID: The channel where Lares will listen

# Choose LLM provider (pick one):
# - LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic (default): Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# - LLM_PROVIDER=openai: Requires OPENAI_API_KEY
# - LLM_PROVIDER=ollama: Local models, no API key needed
#   Set OLLAMA_BASE_URL if not localhost:11434
#   Set OLLAMA_MODEL for model choice (default: llama3.2)

# Choose memory mode:
# - USE_DIRECT_LLM=true: Use SQLite + Claude directly (recommended)
# - USE_DIRECT_LLM=false: Use Letta for memory management
# - MEMORY_PROVIDER=sqlite: SQLite memory (for direct mode)
# - MEMORY_PROVIDER=letta: Letta memory (for Letta mode)

# For Letta mode only:
# - LETTA_API_KEY: From app.letta.com (or use LETTA_BASE_URL for self-hosted)

# Optional integrations:
# - BLUESKY_HANDLE: Your BlueSky handle (e.g., user.bsky.social)
# - BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD: App password from BlueSky settings
# - OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH: Path to your Obsidian vault folder
# - LARES_MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS: Max tool iterations per message (default: 10)
# - CONTEXT_LIMIT: Token limit for context (default: 50000)
# - COMPACT_THRESHOLD: Trigger compaction at % of limit (default: 0.70)
```

### Running

#### Development Mode

For testing and development:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run Lares directly
python run.py
# or if installed: lares
```

On first run, Lares will create a new agent and print an `LARES_AGENT_ID` - add this to your `.env` to persist the agent across restarts.

#### Production Mode (systemd)

For production deployment with auto-start on boot:

```bash
# Copy the service file
sudo cp lares.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Edit the service file to match your setup
sudo systemctl edit lares.service
# Update User, WorkingDirectory, and paths as needed

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable lares.service
sudo systemctl start lares.service

# View logs
journalctl -u lares.service -f

# Common management commands:
sudo systemctl status lares.service  # Check status
sudo systemctl restart lares.service # Restart Lares
sudo systemctl stop lares.service    # Stop Lares
journalctl -u lares.service -n 50    # View last 50 log lines
```

The systemd service:
- Automatically starts Letta Docker container before Lares
- Restarts on failure
- Runs with proper virtual environment
- Logs to systemd journal
- Persists across reboots when enabled

## Self-Hosting Letta

You can run Letta locally with Docker:

```bash
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

Then set in your `.env`:
```
LETTA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8283
```

## Approval Workflows

Lares implements two types of approval workflows for sensitive operations:

### Command Approval (Synchronous)
When Lares tries to run a shell command not in the allowlist:
1. Sends approval request to Discord with ✅/❌ reactions
2. **Waits up to 5 minutes** for your response
3. If approved: adds command to allowlist and executes
4. If denied or timeout: returns error to Lares

### BlueSky Post Approval (Asynchronous)
When Lares wants to post to BlueSky:
1. Sends approval request to Discord with post preview
2. **Returns immediately** - Lares continues other work
3. You can approve/deny anytime (even hours later)
4. When approved: post is sent to BlueSky
5. When denied: post is discarded

This async pattern prevents Lares from being blocked while waiting for approval.

## Self-Restart Capability

Lares can restart itself when needed (e.g., after updates, configuration changes, or for maintenance). This requires passwordless sudo access for the restart command.

### Setup

Run the setup script during installation (requires sudo):

```bash
sudo bash scripts/setup-sudoers.sh
```

This configures passwordless sudo for **only** the specific command:
```bash
systemctl restart lares.service
```

### Security Note

The sudoers configuration is minimal and scoped:
- Only allows restarting the `lares.service` systemd unit
- No other sudo commands are affected
- Standard Linux pattern for service self-management

### Usage

Once configured, Lares can restart itself by calling the `restart_lares()` tool:

```python
# Lares can decide when to restart, such as:
# - After git pull to apply updates
# - When .env configuration changes
# - For periodic maintenance during perch time
# - Recovery from suspected issues
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run linter
ruff check src/

# Run type checker
mypy src/
```

### Dual Architecture: Letta vs Direct Mode

Lares supports two operational modes:

#### 1. Letta Mode (Legacy)
- Uses Letta for both LLM orchestration and memory management
- All conversation and tool execution handled by Letta
- Memory compaction managed by Letta automatically
- Configuration: `USE_DIRECT_LLM=false`, `MEMORY_PROVIDER=letta`

#### 2. Direct LLM Mode (Recommended)
- Direct integration with Claude API via Anthropic SDK
- SQLite database for memory persistence
- Custom orchestrator handles tool loop
- Automatic memory compaction when approaching token limits
- Configuration: `USE_DIRECT_LLM=true`, `MEMORY_PROVIDER=sqlite`

### Data Flow in Direct Mode

```
Discord Message → MCP Server (SSE) → LaresCore → Orchestrator
                                                      ↓
                                            [Tool Loop]
                                            1. Get context from SQLite
                                            2. Call Claude API
                                            3. Execute tools if needed
                                            4. Loop until done
                                                      ↓
                                            Discord Response
```

### Key Abstractions

#### Orchestrator
Central coordinator that manages the tool execution loop:
- Coordinates between LLM, Memory, and Tool providers
- Handles iterative tool calling (max 10 iterations by default)
- Manages context and token usage
- Triggers memory compaction when needed

#### Provider Interfaces
Swappable implementations for core functionality:
- **LLMProvider**: Interface for language models (Anthropic/Claude implemented)
- **MemoryProvider**: Interface for memory storage (SQLite, Letta)
- **ToolExecutor**: Async tool execution with Discord integration

#### Memory Management
- **SQLite Schema**: `messages`, `memory_blocks`, `summaries` tables
- **Automatic Compaction**: Triggers at 70% of context limit (default 35k/50k tokens)
- **Session Buffer**: Short-term memory within a conversation
- **Migration Tool**: `scripts/migrate_letta_to_sqlite.py` for transitioning from Letta

### Memory Compaction Recovery

Lares gracefully handles Letta's automatic memory compaction when conversations exceed context limits:

1. **Detection**: System alerts about memory constraints are automatically detected
2. **Notification**: Shows "💭 *Reorganizing my thoughts...*" in Discord
3. **Automatic Retry**: The interrupted operation is retried after compaction
4. **Continuity**: Lares completes intended actions (especially important during perch time)

This ensures Lares never gets "stunned" by memory compaction and maintains continuous operation.

### Memory Blocks

Lares uses four memory blocks:

| Block | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `persona` | Lares's identity and personality |
| `human` | Information about you |
| `state` | Current working memory and tasks |
| `ideas` | Feature ideas and future plans |

### Skills (Procedural Memory)

Skills are markdown files that teach Lares how to perform specific tasks. Inspired by [Letta Code's skill learning](https://www.letta.com/blog/skill-learning), they provide:

- **Persistent procedural knowledge** that survives context resets
- **On-demand loading** - only loaded when needed (context-efficient)
- **Learn from experience** - new skills created after successful task completion

Example skills in `examples/skills/`:
- `git-workflow.md` - Version control patterns
- `perch-tick.md` - Autonomous time decision framework  
- `discord-interaction.md` - Communication patterns

Skills are indexed in Lares's persona (lightweight pointers) and loaded via `read_file` when performing related tasks.

### Troubleshooting

#### Discord Reactions Not Working
If Discord reactions fail with "Unknown Message" errors:
1. Ensure the MCP server has been restarted after updates
2. Check that the bot has proper permissions in the Discord channel
3. Verify `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` matches where messages are being sent
4. The system now intelligently tracks message IDs and ignores any fake IDs that the LLM might generate

#### Memory Compaction Issues
If you see frequent memory compaction:
1. Adjust `CONTEXT_LIMIT` (default 50000 tokens)
2. Adjust `COMPACT_THRESHOLD` (default 0.70 = compact at 70% full)
3. Consider clearing old conversations with migration tool

#### Tool Execution Not Working
If tools appear as text like "[Tool-only response: ...]":
1. Ensure `USE_DIRECT_LLM=true` for direct mode
2. Restart the MCP server after configuration changes
3. Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is valid

## MCP Server

Lares includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes tools in a framework-agnostic way. This enables portability - you can connect any MCP-compatible system (Letta, Claude Desktop, etc.) to use Lares tools.

### Running the MCP Server

```bash
# Start the MCP server (default: http://0.0.0.0:8765)
python -m lares.mcp_server

# Or as a systemd service (see lares-mcp.service)
```

### MCP Tools (13)

The MCP server provides these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_shell_command` | Execute shell commands (with approval for non-allowlisted) |
| `read_file` | Read files from allowed directories |
| `write_file` | Write files to allowed directories |
| `list_directory` | List contents of a directory |
| `read_rss_feed` | Read RSS/Atom feeds |
| `read_bluesky_user` | Read posts from a BlueSky user |
| `search_bluesky` | Search BlueSky posts |
| `post_to_bluesky` | Post to BlueSky with @mention support (requires approval) |
| `follow_bluesky_user` | Follow a user on BlueSky (no approval) |
| `unfollow_bluesky_user` | Unfollow a user on BlueSky (no approval) |
| `reply_to_bluesky_post` | Reply to a BlueSky post (requires approval) |
| `search_obsidian_notes` | Search notes in Obsidian vault |
| `read_obsidian_note` | Read a specific note from Obsidian |

### Approval Queue

The MCP server includes an HTTP-based approval queue for sensitive operations:

```
GET  /approvals/pending      - List pending approvals
GET  /approvals/{id}         - Get specific approval
POST /approvals/{id}/approve - Approve and execute
POST /approvals/{id}/deny    - Deny request
GET  /health                 - Health check
```

Lares bridges this queue to Discord, allowing you to approve/deny via reactions.

### Connecting Letta to MCP

Lares automatically connects to the MCP server and attaches tools to the Letta agent. Configuration in `.env`:

```
LARES_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8765/sse
```
